## My MacOS Apps - The ones that I use that is

Welcome to my repo!

Here I will share what apps and tools I've found useful for my daily routines, be work or personal related.

I will try and split them in categories that I find meaningfull for me.

Hope you find something of use.

Cheers,

> I'll be using this repo & README.md to learn how to use git as well, so be patient and have a cold one.

#### Git README markup help ####
#### =================== ####

So, for starters, I used the official **GitHub** documentation to generate this file.

Also, the [markdown-cheatsheet](https://github.com/tchapi/markdown-cheatsheet/blob/master/README.md) repo as well.

Oh, and for emojis the [emoji cheat sheet](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/).

#### App List

**TBD**

#### Productivity Apps

Here's a list of the apps that I've installed and make my life easier.

[Alt Tab for MacOs](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/) - this app mimics the behaviour of Alt+Tab from Windows.
