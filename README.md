# My MacOS Apps

Welcome to my repo!

Here I will share what apps and tools I've found useful for my daily routines, be work or personal related.

I will try and split them in categories that I find meaningfull for me.

Hope you find something of use.

Cheers,

C.

> I'll be using this repo & README.md to learn how to use git as well, so be patient and have a cold one.
